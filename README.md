# Cross-Platform Video Calling App

A real-time, cross-platform **video calling application** built with **Flutter**, **WebRTC**, and **Firebase**.  
This project demonstrates a full implementation of peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, signaling, and session management — all wrapped in a modern, scalable mobile UI.

## Overview

This app allows two or more users to connect via secure, low-latency video calls using WebRTC.  
It leverages Firebase for user authentication and signaling, with real-time updates to manage session creation, joining, and teardown.

Built to run on **Android**, **iOS**, and **Web** from a single Flutter codebase.
