# Cross-Platform Video Calling App

A real-time, cross-platform **video calling application** built with **Flutter**, **WebRTC**, and **Firebase**.  
This project demonstrates a full implementation of peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, signaling, and session management — all wrapped in a modern, scalable mobile UI.

---

## Overview

This app allows two or more users to connect via secure, low-latency video calls using WebRTC.  
It leverages Firebase for user authentication and signaling, with real-time updates to manage session creation, joining, and teardown.

Built to run on **Android**, **iOS**, and **Web** from a single Flutter codebase.

## Features

✅ **Real-Time Video Calls** — Uses WebRTC for peer-to-peer streaming  
✅ **Firebase Signaling** — Handles call offers, answers, and ICE candidates  
✅ **User Authentication** — Simple email/password login via Firebase Auth  
✅ **Call Rooms** — Create and join dynamic call rooms with unique IDs  
✅ **Mute, Camera Toggle, and End Call Controls**  
✅ **Responsive Cross-Platform UI** (mobile + web support)  
✅ **Deployed via Codemagic CI/CD** for automated testing and build pipelines
